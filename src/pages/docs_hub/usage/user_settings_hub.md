## Organization

The organization consists of a name, which is unique and not changeable, and members. The admin can add more people to the organization. There are two roles **Admin** and **User**. The admin can configure the whole account, search and invite new people while the user can just configure the workspace and search within it.

Inviting people is done via a popup. The admin needs to specify the email address and a role for the user. The user will receive an email with an invitation link. The new user can sign up to Haystack Hub and will be connected to the organization.
