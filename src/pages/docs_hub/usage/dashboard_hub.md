## Workspace Statistic

Haystack Hub provides statistics regarding your search. This helps to analyze the performance of your workspace. Moreover, you can make sure to react before you reach the limit of your subscription level.

### Number of Requests for the Last Month

The section workspace statistics consist of 4 key figures which summarizes the most important numbers:

* **Number of files** which you uploaded to your workspace
* **Number of docs** after preprocessing
* **Average Response Time** of your requests 
* **Number of Requests today** within your workspace

These figures help you to keep track of your workspace performance and subscription boundaries.
