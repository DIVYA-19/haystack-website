# Search

Haystack Hub enables you to search your text documents. After you uploaded your [documents](/docs_hub/upload_documentsmd), you can start searching. Either you click **Search**  in the menu or **Your Search is ready** on the dashboard. When you enter the page, you will find a search bar where you can **ask your question**.

In order to search your question, enter it in the search bar and click **enter** or **Search**. After a few seconds, Haystack Hub will return the answers ordered by **Relevance**. The Relevance shows how likely the provided answer will fit with your question. 

The answer is always provided together with the context and is marked in bold. The title above the text is the file name in which the answer was found. You can download the file by clicking **Download the File**.
