Haystack Pipelines chain together various Haystack components to build a search system. Haystack comes with a number of predefined pipelines that fit most standard search patterns, allowing you to build a QA system in no time.

## ExtractiveQAPipeline

Extractive QA is the task of searching through a large collection of documents for a span of text that answers a question. The ExtractiveQAPipeline combines the Retriever and the Reader such that:
- The [Retriever](/usage/retriever) combs through a database and returns only the documents that it deems to be the most relevant to the query.
- The [Reader](/usage/reader) accepts the documents returned by the Retriever and selects a text span as the answer to the query.

Note that outside of a pipeline, Readers and Retrievers accept a `top_k` parameter, which specifies the number of documents that they should return per query. However, inside the pipeline, these parameters are renamed to `top_k_retriever` and `top_k_reader`.

```python
pipeline = ExtractiveQAPipeline(reader, retriever)

query = "What is Hagrid's dog's name?"
result = pipeline.run(query=query, top_k_retriever=10, top_k_reader=1)
```

The output of the pipeline is a Python dictionary with answers stored under the `answers` key. The output provides additional information such as the context from which the answer was extracted and the model’s confidence in the accuracy of the extracted answer.

```python
result["answers"]
>>> [{  'answer': 'Fang',
        'score': 13.26807975769043,
        'probability': 0.9657130837440491,
        'context': Криволапик (Kryvolapyk, kryvi lapy "crooked paws")
                   ===Fang (Hagrid's dog)===
                   *Chinese (PRC): 牙牙 (ya2 ya) (from 牙 "tooth", 牙,
...}]
```
