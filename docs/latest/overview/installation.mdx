# Installation

## Basic Installation

You can install a basic version of Haystack's latest release by using [pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip).

```
pip install farm-haystack
```

This command will install everything needed for basic Pipelines that use an Elasticsearch Document Store.

## Full Installation

If you plan to be using more advanced features like Milvus, FAISS, Weaviate, OCR or Ray,
you will need to install a full version of Haystack.
The following command will install the latest version of Haystack from the master branch.

```
git clone https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack.git
cd haystack
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .[all] ## or 'all-gpu' for the GPU-enabled dependencies
```

The `-e` flag makes this an editable installation meaning that changes to the cloned repo will affect how the package runs.
You can call `git pull` on the repo to update.

If the `install` command does not work for you and you have `pip<21.3`, see [Custom Installation](/overview/installation#custom-installation)

## REST API and UI

Run the following from the root directory of the Haystack repo

```
pip install rest_api/
pip install ui/
```

## Installing on Windows

```
pip install farm-haystack -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```

## Installing on Apple Silicon (M1)

M1 Macbooks require some extra depencies in order to install Haystack.

```
# some additional dependencies needed on m1 mac
brew install postgresql
brew install cmake
brew install rust

# haystack installation
GRPC_PYTHON_BUILD_SYSTEM_ZLIB=true pip install farm-haystack
```

## Custom Installation

To install groups of dependencies along with Haystack, specify them in the `pip install` command.
The dependencies of Haystack are split into different groupings which you can find in `haystack/setup.cfg`.

```
pip install -e .[all]            # install haystack and all depedencies
pip install -e .[all-gpu]        # install haystack, all dependencies and gpu support
pip install -e .[docstores-gpu]  # install haystack, all docstores and gpu support
pip install -e .[docstores-gpu]  # install haystack, all docstores and gpu support

```

If you are running `pip<21.3` you won't be able to install dependency groups that reference other groups.
Instead you can only specify groups that contain direct package references.

```
# instead of [all]
pip install -e .[sql,only-faiss,only-milvus1,weaviate,graphdb,crawler,preprocessing,ocr,onnx,ray,dev]

# instead of [all-gpu]
pip install -e .[sql,only-faiss-gpu,only-milvus1,weaviate,graphdb,crawler,preprocessing,ocr,onnx-gpu,ray,dev]
```
